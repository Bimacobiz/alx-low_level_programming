Files:
Below is a brief description of all the files in this directory:

dog.h: This is the header file that contains the definition of the structure "dog" and prototypes for the functions used in the program "1-init_dog.c".
1-init_dog.c: This program demonstrates how to initialize a structure of type "dog" using the function "init_dog" and print its values using the function "print_dog".
2-print_dog.c: This program demonstrates how to print the values of a structure of type "dog" using the function "print_dog".
dog.h: This header file contains the definition of the structure "dog" and the prototype of the function "print_dog".
4-new_dog.c: This program demonstrates how to create a new structure of type "dog" using the function "new_dog" and print its values using the function "print_dog".
5-free_dog.c: This program demonstrates how to free the memory allocated to a structure of type "dog" using the function "free_dog".
