This project explores file input or output in the C programming language. File i/o is an important concept in software engineering because it explains how a computer writes and reads from files in a disk. It is important for several tasks such as data persistence, handling larget databases and reading configuration files. This project contains various programs that demonstrate various file i/o operations. Each program has a specific purpose. 
The project contains various files namely:
1. 0-read_textfile.c - a function that reads a text file then prints it to the POSIX standard output. 
2. 1-create_file.c - creates a file 
3. 2-append_text_to_file.c - appends text to the end of a file
4. 3-cp.c - copies content from one file to the other
5. 100-elf_header.c - displays the information that is contained in an ELF file
