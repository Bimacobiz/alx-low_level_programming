Welcome to the Bit Manipulation directory, which is part of the alx-low_level_programming repository. It contains C programming source files that demonstrate how bit manipulation works in software engineering.
Programs included are:
0-binary_to_uint.c: which is a program that converts a binary string into an unsigned integer.

1-print_binary.c: which prints the binary form of a number.

2-get_bit.c: Which retrieves a bit valuie at a given index.

3-set_bit.c: Which sets the value of a given bit at a given index to 1.

4-clear_bit.c: Which sets the value of a given bit at a given index to 0.

5-flip_bits.c: Which calculates the number of bits that are required to convert one number to the other.

6-get_endianess: which which checks endianess

101-password: which contains the password of a given program
