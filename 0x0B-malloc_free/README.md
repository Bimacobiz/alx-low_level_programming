0x0B. C - malloc, free
Introduction
This project is part of the low-level programming and algorithm track of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, we learn about dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free functions in C.

Requirements
All files should be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
File Descriptions
0-create_array.c

2-str_concat.c
This function concatenates two strings into a newly allocated space in memory.

3-alloc_grid.c
This function returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers, where each element is initialized to 0.

4-free_grid.c
This function frees a 2-dimensional array of integers previously allocated by the alloc_grid function.

100-argstostr.c
This function concatenates all the arguments passed to the program into a single string, separated by a newline character.
